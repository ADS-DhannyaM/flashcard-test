# shadcn UI Usage

This project uses **shadcn UI** for all UI elements and components.

## Initialization

If shadcn UI is not initialized in the project, initialize it using:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

## Adding Components

When a specific shadcn UI component is needed but not yet installed, add it using:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add <component-name>
```

For example, to install the button component:
```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

## Guidelines

- Always use shadcn UI components instead of creating custom UI elements from scratch
- Check if a component exists before creating a new one
- Follow shadcn UI patterns and conventions when implementing UI features
- Components are typically located in the `components/ui` directory after installation
